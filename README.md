# Poem Generator

This program trains itself to write poetry using a Markov Chain. It generates a complete poem based on a body of text.

A Markov Chain is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property. Essentially, a process satisfies the Markov property if you can predict the future of the process solely on its present state (the full history is not necessary, the process is "memoryless"). A stochastic process is one that is unpredictable because of a random variable. Such a process can be analyzed statistically, but may not be predicted precisely.
